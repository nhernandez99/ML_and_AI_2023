# AI & ML in 2023

#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my work in machine learning and artificial intelligence! Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of my projects covering a wide range of techniques, including dimensionality reduction, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. Using Python and R, I've developed practical solutions to real-world problems, and I'm excited to share my work with you.
